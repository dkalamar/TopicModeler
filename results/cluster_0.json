[
    "David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul, and he said: \u201cYahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine; God is my rock in whom I take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge.",
    "My soul, you have said to Yahweh, \u201cYou are my Lord.",
    "Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.",
    "For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord.",
    "I said, \u201cMy God, don\u2019t take me away in the middle of my days."
