    "For God is the King of all the earth.",
    "the days come\u201d, says the Lord, \u201cthat I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they didn\u2019t continue in my covenant, and I disregarded them,\u201d says the Lord.",
    "The righteousness of the righteous shall be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be on him.",
    "The end of the fear of the Lord is wisdom.",
    "In the multitude of people is the king\u2019s glory, but in the lack of people is the destruction of the prince."
