    "You shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shall appoint it for the service of the Tent of Meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh, to make atonement for your souls.\u201d Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, \u201cYou shall also make a basin of bronze, and its base of bronze, in which to wash. You shall put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.",

    "He shall prepare the sin offering, the meal offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.\u201d \u201c\u00a0\u2018The Lord Yahweh says: \u201cIn the first month, in the first day of the month, you shall take a young bull without defect; and you shall cleanse the sanctuary.",
    "He shall bring them to the priest, who shall first offer the one which is for the sin offering."
